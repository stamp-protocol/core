//! The identity module defines the data types and operations that define a
//! Stamp identity.
//!
//! An identity is essentially a set of keys (signing and encryption), a set of
//! claims made by the identity owner (including the identity itself), any
//! number of signatures that verify those claims, and a set of "forwards" that
//! can point to other locations (for instance, your canonical email address,
//! your personal domain, etc).
//!
//! This system relies heavily on the [key](crate::key) module, which provides
//! all the mechanisms necessary for encryption, decryption, signing, and
//! verification of data.
